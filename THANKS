Sometimes related to the development of frogr, and sometimes not, I'd
like to thank here to some people who helped me in a way or another:

 * My wife, who proved to have infinite patience all the time

 * My first son, who was born right at the same time I started this
   project, so they're some kind of "brothers" or the like.

 * My second son as well, who was born just a few days after the 0.6.1
   release. Including him here simply because I love him so much too.

 * My mates in Igalia, who helped me with ideas, code and even some
   nice artwork such as the logo. Special thanks to Adrian and Berto.

 * Quinn Dombrowski, for the awesome feedback and help provided all
   the time and for being so incredible as to hand craft a beautiful
   vest for my son and a true frogr mascot as a sign of gratitude.

 * Everyone else who I just can't remember at this moment

...and obviously thanks to git, "who" just makes a pleasure to work in
a software project like this one (and probably any other else)

Thanks!
