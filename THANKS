Sometimes related to the development of frogr, and sometimes not, I'd
like to thank here to some people who helped me in a way or another:

 * My girlfriend, who proved to have infinite patience all the time

 * My son, who was born right at the same time I started this project,
   so they're some kind of "brothers" or the like.

 * My mates in Igalia, who helped me with ideas, code and even some
   nice artwork such as the logo. Special thanks to Adrian and Berto.

 * Everyone else who I just can't remember at this moment

...and obviously thanks to git, "who" just makes a pleasure to work in
a software project like this one (and probably any other else)

Thanks!
