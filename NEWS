0.1.1 (22 Aug 2009)

  * Fixed problems with 'make dist' (missing files in EXTRA_DIST)

0.1-1 (21 Aug 2009)

  * A better UI. Faster and better user experience
  * Basic configuration management to store account details (auth token)
  * Support for editing details of multiple pictures at the same time
  * Added status and improved the progress bar usage to show the status
    of async operations, giving a much better feedback to the end user.
  * A better (and more easily hackable) code and design.
  * No more .glade files, no more gtk-builder-convert
  * Avoid libgnome dependency if gtk+ >= 2.14 is present
  * Still implemented some parts of the UI (menubar) without GtkBuilder
    to keep compatibility with Gtk+ 2.12 (least version supported).
  * Bugfixes and several (minor and major) improvements

0.0.20090603 (03 Jun 2009)
