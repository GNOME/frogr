Compiling from source code
==========================

To compile and try the application you need to have meson and ninja
installed, but you can still use the usual commands defined by
the build API (see https://github.com/cgwalters/build-api):

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make install

To use meson and ninja, instead of using the wrapper configure script:

 $ meson . BUILD
 $ ninja -C BUILD
 $ ninja -C BUILD install

...and then you can run it from the directory you installed it with the
previous commands (/usr/local by default unless --prefix is used).
