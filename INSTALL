Building and installing a debian package
========================================

You can easily build a new debian package by doing:

 $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

After that, just install the debian package created in '../'.


Compiling from source code
==========================

To compile and try the application you can just do this:

 $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/tmp
 $ make
 $ make install
 $ ./src/frogr

(Feel free to use another prefix of course, this is just a suggestion)
