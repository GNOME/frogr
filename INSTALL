Compiling from source code
==========================

To compile and try the application you need to have meson and ninja:

 $ meson setup --prefix /local/install/path . BUILD
 $ ninja -C BUILD
 $ ninja -C BUILD install

...and then you can run it from the directory you installed it with the
previous commands (/usr/local by default unless --prefix is used).
