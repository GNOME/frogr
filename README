Note: we distribute the flicksoup files under LGPLv3 instead of GPLv3,
as it happens with the rest of the files in the project, because the
idea is to release it at some point as a library independent from
frogr. However, at the point flicksoup is in an early stage of
development, entirely driven by frogr's needs, so it makes sense to
keep it as part of the project for the time being.
