Currently the code is in a very early stage so it does just the most
basic thing I could think of: upload pictures to a Flickr account.

However, there are many plans for this app and so many features I'd
love to see implemented in the short or mid term, classified in two
groups depending on the scope of the application, which can be:

 - frogr as just a flickr uploader for GNOME (initial stage)
 - frogr as a flickr manager for GNOME (afterwards)

TODO list for the uploader:
===========================

 * Store configuration issues locally, such as the Flickr username and
   the required artifacts to use the REST API (auth token and frob).

 * Add a "Settings" new dialog to allow the user preselect some useful
   and common options (e.g. always upload public pictures by default).

 * New "details dialog" to allow setting pictures properties before
   uploading: description, tags, license, visibility...

 * Allow setting common properties for several pictures at once.

 * Show extra information when uploading, for instance a "x/y"-like
   text over the progress bar telling how many pictures were uploaded.

 * Add a "Cancel" button, to allow interrupting an uploading process
   without having to quit the application, as it is right now :-)

 * Allow adding pictures by just selecting its folder.

 * Add drag & drop support.

 * Allow pre-selecting the target album for a picture before uploading.

 * Improve the authorization dialog.

 * Add contextual menu for right click on a picture (GtkIconView).

 * Reimplement authorization dialog as a GtkMessageDialog

 * etc...


TODO list for the manager:
==========================

 * Allow replacing pictures.

 * Allow editing properties for pictures already uploaded.

 * Allow managing albums properties.

 * etc...


As you can see there is a lot of room for new ideas or even
modifications of the current ones :-). The lists from above are just
the result of a quick brainstorming with myself trying to figure out
the next steps to be done in this application and write them down,
thinking of perhaps some helpful soul apart me which could want to get
dirty with some of them :-).

Anyway, if you have an idea / proposal / criticism do not hesitate to
tell about. It will be helpful and appreciated for sure. See the
README file for more information about how to get in contact and
become part of the development of this project.

Thanks!
